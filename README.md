This repo contains my answers for the excellent 'Nand2Tetris' course you will find online (https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

## Please do not cheat !!!

Real learning happens when you make mistakes, so if you are stuck on a part of the course please persevere and try to work out the correct answer. This will teach you much more than simply looking at someone elses answers. You should also check out the course forums for help with issues (http://nand2tetris-questions-and-answers-forum.32033.n3.nabble.com/).

And regarding my ansers here... although they should all work to the best of my knowledge they may also be very poor solutions... so don't trust my answers as any sort of valid learning resource. This repo is mainly on here as a personal backup and possibly as a last ditch resort for anyone but me 8).
